# JavaScript30 Challenge by Wes Bos

This repository contains my daily projects from the **JavaScript30 Challenge**, a 30-day challenge designed to improve JavaScript skills by building various projects with **vanilla JavaScript**. No frameworks or libraries, just pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!

### Prerequisites
To view or run any project locally, all you need is a modern web browser.
